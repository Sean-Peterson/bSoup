What I want to do:
Create an array of url's that includes every product that we want
Iterate through each of them and grab the information that we want
Push that info to an array where each group of information is saved together as a single index in the array
Create another function that parses that information into useful x=y info where x is the feature and y is the value
Export all of that information to an excel spreadsheet, or something.



NEXT UP
there are exactly 13 categories that we are tracking
we need to make each of them a parent array
we might also need to make the subheading a child array and then the values their children.
